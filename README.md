I know 1004 holds and I wrote them all down. -Chris Jericho

This brief guidance helps you better understand how this gallery organizes pro wrestling moves. Descriptions below are mostly personal opinions, and might be incorrect at any time. It will be AWESOME if you tell me your thoughts and advice :)

### Naming of a move

Naming of a move consists of three parts:

1. main part
2. decoration part
3. version part

Example: [Double underhook facebuster(lifting sitout version)](https://github.com/MeltzerDriver/Pro-Wrestling-Move-Gallery/blob/main/Throws/Facebusters/7.1.4%20Double%20underhook%20facebuster(lifting%20sitout%20version).gif)

"Double underhook facebuster" is the *main part*. It is the unique symbol of a particular pro wrestling move. It always appears on the title.

"lifting" is the *decoration part*. It helps polishing the move, but not a must option. It usually appears in the brackets.

> Common decoration parts include:
>
> * twisting
> * spinning
> * lifting

"sitout version" is the *version part*. It indicates the performing version of this move. It usually appears in the brackets as "XX version". 

> Common version parts include:
>
> * sitout version
> * kneeling version
> * falling version
>
> Different moves have their own default versions.

### Definition

**Aerial techniques vs Drop attacks**

*Aerial techniques* emphasize on the flipping motion in the air, such as front flips, back flips and corkscrews;

*Drop attacks* emphasize on the body parts used to attack the opponent, such as elbow drops.

**"inverted" vs "reverse"**

*Inverted* moves see a wrestler turns himself / herself around while performing the moves.

*Reverse* moves see a wrestler turns his / her opponent around while performing the moves.

In addition, *reverse* moves also indicate that a wrestler performs the moves in the opposite direction.

[Reverse bulldog](https://github.com/MeltzerDriver/Pro-Wrestling-Move-Gallery/blob/main/Throws/Mat%20slams/5.1.1%20Reverse%20bulldog%7B2%7D.gif)

Due to different explanations, there are two Reverse bulldogs in this gallery. Can you guess what the other one looks like?

Please notice that Inverted facelock is compared to Facelock, not Front facelock. Also, Inverted DDT / suplex is short for Inverted facelock DDT / suplex.

**"twisting" vs "spinning" vs "spin-out" vs "swinging"**

*Twisting* means a wrestler spins around while still standing where he / she is.

### Ignore list

I've dropped out the following moves, because they are either not essentially changing the motion or too difficult to distinguish.

* running moves
* jumping moves
* diving attacks
* standing aerial techniques
* slingshot aerial techniques
* springboard aerial techniques
* delayed throws
* elevated throws
* avalanche throws
* high-angle throws
* bridging suplexes

### Just so you know

* Modified moves always come with their users in square brackets.
* A lariat is essentially a very stiff, swinging clothesline, according to Wikipedia.
